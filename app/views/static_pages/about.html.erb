      In 2003, I began studying massage and working as resource coordinator, office administrator, and continuing education coordinator at the Natural Health Institute.
      <br>
      <br>
      Upon graduation and licensure in 2005, I started a bodywork practice in the NHI clinic and in 2007 became an instructor. I created the Sound Body IntegrationÂ© class to share the healing power of sound with others. Currently in my tenth year of practice, I continue to provide education, awareness and integral holistic therapy.
