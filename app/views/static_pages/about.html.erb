      ABOUT ME
  Originally from Charleston, SC, I moved to Nashville, TN in 1997 to attend Belmont University. In 2001 I received my BA in music and continued to study sound & healing which eventually led me to massage and bodywork.
  <br>
  <br>

  In 2003, I began studying massage and working as resource coordinator, office administrator, and continuing education coordinator at the Natural Health Institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Upon graduation and licensure in 2005, I started a bodywork practice in the NHI clinic and in 2007 became an instructor. I created the Sound Body IntegrationÂ© class to share the healing power of sound with others. Currently in my tenth year of practice, I continue to provide education, awareness and integral holistic therapy.
  <br>
  <br>

  I live with my wife and four beautiful children in the rolling hills of Bellevue where we enjoy nature, music, art, play time, gardening, and meals with friends and family.
