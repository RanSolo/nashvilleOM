  about_lew:
    Originally from Charleston, SC, I moved to Nashville, TN in 1997 to attend
    Belmont University. In 2001 I received my BA in music and continued to study
    sound & healing which eventually led me to massage and bodywork.

      Born and raised in the funky city of Atlanta, GA., I grew up in a very
      culturally diverse and progressive urban environment that was steeped in
      traditional southern American values & history. Throughout my childhood,
      I was always very active, athletic and adventurous. This athleticism is
      what lead me to sports, which lead me to weight lifting, which in turn
      eventually lead me to chronic pain, which thankfully lead me to massage
      therapy.
    </p>

      I went to college at The Evergreen State College in Olympia, WA. It was
      there, in the temperate rainforest of the Pacific Northwest where I truly
      fell in-love with Mother Nature and began to embrace a much more natural
      and consciously aware lifestyle. It was while in college, that I found
      Aikido. Being exposed to the eastern concepts of Chi/Ki /Qi (Life force
      energy), has had an infinitely expansive impact on my life. Aikido in turn
      lead me directly to massage therapy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to massage school at “The Scherer’s Institute of Natural Healing”
      in Santa Fe, NM. It was here in massage school, where I heard & found my
      “calling” in this life! I found a love and passion in massage therapy and
      its relevant natural sciences that was very unexpected yet greatly
      appreciated. Two years after massage school, I sought out advanced
      certification training in Neuromuscular therapy (NMT) at the “Heartwood
      Institute” in Garberville, CA.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began teaching massage therapy curriculum at the “Natural Health
      Institute” (NHI) here in Nashville in 2002. It was here in a classroom,
      that I was able to combine my talent & love for entertaining others with
      my passion for massage therapy and proficient knowledge of the human
      anatomy. I have taught all classes & subjects of massage therapy
      curriculum throughout my career.

      In 2004, Temple style Lomi Lomi found me. This is a unique and sacred form
      of massage & bodywork that is indigenous only to the Hawaiian islands and
      culture. Lomi is a very different style of bodywork than what most
      westerners are accustomed to. This modality combines my current love and
      appreciation of sensuality and the power of touch with my adoration for
      the traditional Hawaiian culture. Every session I do, I constantly look
      for opportunities to implement Lomi wherever appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2012, I started learning Myo-Fascial Trigger-point Therapy (MTPT).
      This modality’s very systematic clinical approach to specific treatments
      of chronic pain is very  similar to NMT. They are parallel secondary
      branches from the same “Deep tissue” limb on the Massage tree. Learning
      MTPT has deepened my understanding of chronic pain, postural assessment,
      postural patterns of dis-function and perpetuating factors of dis-function
      tenfold. I am currently pursuing my certification in this modality.

      Within the last two years, I have become increasingly intrigued by the
      near infinite possibilities of “Cupping”. I took a Medi-cupping &
      Acu-cupping class and have been hooked since. I practice cupping on my
      willing clients whenever possible. The more I practice, the better I get.
      I practice cupping on myself weekly. It has so many therapeutic benefits,
      stimulating almost every system in the body to increase homeostasis,
      improve ROM, influence chi/energy, release adhesions as well as reduce
      inflammation & edema.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know this much... music, massage therapy & NMT are the “true loves” of
      my life! I have dedicated my life to this pursuit and quest. I have spent
      half of my life walking this path and I still genuinely love it everyday!
      I believe in pioneering a paradigm shift in the consciousness of the
      modern American minds...that this is/should be your true “health care.”
    </p>
    <p>
      In my opinion, traditional western medicine should be considered more as
      “sick care.” The unfortunate bitter truth is that modern western medicine
      is managed by corrupt gigantic pharmaceutical corporations interested
      predominantly in money. The business plan is to keep you just sick
      enough... Unfortunately, most western medical physicians too are limited
      by either proper knowledge or actual ability & power to truly help you
      heal, other than formulaic surgery and drugs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not at all interested in chasing nor “treating” symptoms. The
      “symptom” simply develops because of a deeper root problem. Thus, I read
      the symptom(s) as a direct indication of the loss and/or absence of
      “harmony” within the organism, oftentimes due to unidentified perpetuating
      factors (UPF’s). Through intelligent and proper postural assessment of the
      body in addition to a thorough consultation, commonly the UPF influences
      can be properly identified and therapeutically addressed and or evaluated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyday, I consciously strive to shine light into the darkness. To
      selflessly serve others in the name of love. My personal goal is to
      eradicate and transform “FUD”(Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) energy into the
      “3 C’s”(Clarity, Certainty, Confidence). Thoughts lead directly to
      behavior... Through shifting our perspective, we open ourselves to the
      infinite possibilities of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      * PLEASE NOTE: I have a very straightforward “50/50 rule” to my approach
      of bodywork. As your therapist, you hold me 50% accountable to providing
      you with the very highest quality of care and education while you are in
      my care or on my table. In turn, I hold you my client, 50% accountable to
      listening well enough to know exactly what to do for your own personal
      “homework” in between our sessions, to better further your therapeutic
      progression out of chronic pain as well as empower yourself through guided
      quality education in self-care. The truth is that you have a lot more time
      with “you” than I do! So, please do your homework and you will feel much
      better, much more quickly! Thank you,
    </p>
