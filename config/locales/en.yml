  about_lew:
    Originally from Charleston, SC, I moved to Nashville, TN in 1997 to attend
    Belmont University. In 2001 I received my BA in music and continued to study
    sound & healing which eventually led me to massage and bodywork.

      Everyday I strive to eradicate FUD behavior (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) and
      replace it with the 3 C’s (Clarity, Certainty, Confidence).” My personal
      quest is to “remove the darkness” for others in need. I specialize in Deep
      tissue, NMT, MTPT, Sports massage, Lomi-Lomi & PNF. My bodywork is
      centered around chronic pain treatment and relief.

    <p>
      Born and raised in the funky city of Atlanta, GA., I grew up in a very
      culturally diverse urban environment that was steeped in southern American
      values & history. Throughout my childhood, I was always very active,
      athletic and adventurous. Soccer has always been a passion and hobby of
      mine ever since I can remember. I stopped playing competitively after
      graduating high school but never lost love for the sport.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to The Evergreen State College in Olympia, WA. It was there, in the
      temperate rainforest of the Pacific Northwest where I truly fell in-love
      with Mother Nature and began to embrace a much more natural and
      consciously aware lifestyle. It was also while in college when I found
      Aikido, a Japanese form of martial arts that is deeply rooted in
      harmonizing energies. Being exposed to the eastern concepts of Chi/Ki /Qi
      (Life force energy), has had such an infinitely expansive impact on my
      life. I only practiced aikido for two years but it has had a profound
      impact on me so far.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aikido in turn lead me directly to massage therapy. It was immediately
      after several of these Aikido classes when I was first exposed to the
      powers of massage. My sensei’s wife was a Hawaiian native massage
      therapist who practiced Lomi Lomi, a traditional form of Hawaiian massage.
      She would sometimes notice me wincing in pain after class. She’d invite me
      to sit on the floor in front of her where she’d kindly massage my aching
      body for several minutes, wherever it was hurting the most at the
      time...almost magically improving my overall condition & disposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is when & where the metaphorical “stars” began to come into focus,
      align and shine brightly for me! She sparked a curiosity within me that
      I was totally unaware of. This curiosity grew into a fascination, which
      grew into a thirst, which eventually continued into a lifestyle...of
      which just so happens to be that which I lovingly refer to as the past
      21+ years of my life!
    </p>
    <p>
      Those brief experiences with her on that mat ended up having such a
      tremendous impact upon my life, it set the course for a whole new chapter
      to begin in my own personal development. I soon ended up finding myself
      so intrigued by the prospects of massage therapy that I dropped out of
      college and moved out to Santa Fe, NM. Where I began attending “The
      Scherer’s Institute of Natural Healing.” It was here in massage school,
      where I heard & found my “calling” in this life! I found a love and
      passion in massage therapy and its relevant natural sciences that was very
      unexpected yet greatly appreciated. It has now been more than 21 years
      walking this path, and I regret nothing!
    </p>
    <p>
      Two years after completion of massage school and building a small
      private practice in Olympia, WA., I sought out advanced certification
      training in Neuromuscular therapy (NMT) at the “Heartwood Institute” in
      Garberville, CA. Along with music, massage therapy & NMT are  the “true
      loves” of my life! I have dedicated my life to this pursuit and quest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like many others in the past, I initially moved to Nashville, TN to
      peruse my dreams in the music industry. However, a lot of that changed
      for me when I began teaching massage therapy  curriculum at the “Natural
      Health Institute” (NHI) in 2002. It was here, that I was able to combine
      my strength and love for entertaining others with my passion for
      massage therapy. I have taught all classes & subjects of massage
      curriculum at four schools over the past 16 years.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2004, Temple style Lomi Lomi re-appeared on my radar (This was the
      same form of bodywork that my sensei’s wife, Tina, practiced). The more
      that I learned about Lomi, the more fascinated I became. This modality
      combined my current love and appreciation of sensuality and touch with
      my adoration for the Hawaiian culture. Still to this day, in every
      session I do, I constantly look for opportunities to implement Lomi
      wherever appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2005, I stumbled across Lotus palm&#58; Thai yoga massage. I thought
      that this technique was amazing! This was such an incredibly different
      approach to bodywork than almost anything else that I had previously
      practiced. This technique married my love for yoga and Buddhism with
      massage in such a beautifully eastern way. Very parallel and similar to
      Lomi Lomi and the Hawaiian culture, Thai yoga massage is unique and
      specific to the Thai culture. I have always found these two cultures and
      their unique approach to massage to be very complimentary to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2012, I discovered Mrs. Sharon Sauer and Myo-Fascial Trigger-point
      Therapy (MTPT). This modality technique and it’s clinical approach to
      specific treatments of chronic pain is incredibly similar to NMT.
      They are parallel secondary branches from the same “Deep tissue” limb on
      the Massage tree. Learning MTPT has deepened my understanding of chronic
      pain, postural assessment, postural patterns of dis-function and
      perpetuating factors of dis-function tenfold. I have been continuing to
      study under Sharon Sauer ever since. I am currently pursuing my
      certification in this modality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the last two years, I have become increasingly intrigued by the
      near infinite possibilities of “Cupping”. I took a Medi-cupping &
      Acu-cupping class and have been hooked since. I practice cupping on my
      willing clients whenever possible. The more I practice, the better I
      get. I practice cupping on myself weekly. It has so many therapeutic
      benefits, stimulating almost every system in the body to increase
      homeostasis, improve ROM, release adhesions as well as reduce
      inflammation & edema.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout my career thus far, I’ve held licensure in four states
      (WA, TN, NC, AL). However, since 1998 Nashville, TN. has been “home” for
      me. I have really enjoyed living here over the past twenty years,
      watching the culture change as the city continues to grow, change and
      expand. I enjoy being an active participant in my community and giving
      back whenever possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      I look forward to collaborating with Lew at NOM. I know that our
      personal intentions behind the bodywork that we each practice is very
      complimentary towards achieving the same goal. Not to mention, that I
      now get to work with one of my best friends and favorite former students
      to better understand and facilitate the natural healing process on a
      profound level, all while continuing to pioneer a paradigm shift in the
      consciousness of the modern American minds...that this is true “health
      care.
    </p>
    <p>
      Traditional western medicine should be considered as “sick care.”
      Unfortunately, the bitter truth is that modern western medicine is
      managed by corrupt gigantic pharmaceutical corporations. The business
      plan is to keep you just sick enough... Unfortunately, most western
      medical physicians too are limited by either proper knowledge or actual
      ability & power to truly help you heal, other than surgery and drugs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not at all interested in chasing nor “treating” symptoms. The
      “symptom” simply develops because of a deeper root problem. Thus, I read
      the symptom(s) as a direct indication of the loss and/or absence of
      “harmony” within the organism, oftentimes due to unidentified
      perpetuating factors (UPF’s). Through intelligent and proper assessment
      of the body in addition to a thorough consultation, commonly the UPF
      influences can be properly identified and therapeutically addressed and
      or evaluated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever I am not working on bodies, I enjoy almost anything outdoors...
      Nature, Arts, Music, Sports or Science related. One of my favorite
      hobbies is playing and producing music with my friends. I am an natural
      percussionist and will gladly bang on any drum if given the opportunity.
      However, I don’t discriminate against any instrument! I am a very
      relaxed and positive person. Love is my religion and I am a true
      believer. I look forward to meeting you and seeing you on my table soon!
    </p>
    <p>
      * I have a very straightforward “50/50 rule” to my approach of bodywork.
      As your therapist, you hold me 50% accountable to providing you with the
      very highest quality of care and education while you are in my care or on
      my table. In turn, I hold you my client, 50% accountable to listening well
      enough to know exactly what to do for your own personal “homework” in
      between our sessions, to better further your therapeutic progression as
      well as empower yourself through quality education of self-healing. The
      truth is you have a lot more time with “you” than I do! So, do your
      homework and you will feel much better, much quicker! Thank you,
    </p>
